3-Tier DevSecOps Project: User Management DemoThis repository contains a simple Node.js API and a React client designed to demonstrate a basic user management application. This project serves as a practical example of a 3-tier architecture within a DevSecOps pipeline.üöÄ Getting StartedFollow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:Node.js: Version 18.x or later is recommended. You can download it from nodejs.org.üõ†Ô∏è Setup and InstallationClone the repository (if you haven't already):git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
Install API Dependencies: Navigate to the api directory and install the required npm packages.cd api
npm install
Install Client Dependencies: Navigate to the client directory from the root folder and install its npm packages.cd ../client
npm install
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the ApplicationYou will need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend API and the frontend client simultaneously.Start the API Server:In your first terminal, navigate to the api directory and run the start command.cd api
npm start
The API will typically start on http://localhost:8080 or another specified port.Start the React Client:In your second terminal, navigate to the client directory and run the start command.cd client
npm start
This will launch the development server for the React application.View in Browser:Once the client has started, open your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:3000You should now see the user management application running!
